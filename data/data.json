As Alfonso began to develop a more modern take on fillings, the two decided to divide and conquer. El Gordo now offers over 50 empanada flavours, ranging from the expected (beef, chorizo, cheese), to the arcane (chicken and kimchi). The chorizo empanadas ($3) are particularly crave-worthy, with its silky smooth pimenton-spiked filling. So many tempting options, so little time.",

All the usuals are done well, but for a special treat, try ordering from the 'Inihaw' menu. If you didn't know, 'Ihaw' means 'to grill' or to 'roast on coals' and you're not doing that in your own kitchen. The usual grilled Pork BBQ is on the menu, but so are grilled shrimp, squid, tilapia and my favourite, the grilled Bangus (Milk Fish). Any Filipino grill food immediately reminds me of summertime picnics trying to scam some free BBQ by pretending to be a distant cousin! No need to pretend here, Mayette will make you feel like part of the family.",
